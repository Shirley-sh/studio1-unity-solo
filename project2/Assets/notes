- Visual effect on the place you click
- End state (switch levels when you hold all their hands, and when you win the game)
- Visual effect when you've held an otter's hand (so you don't go to hold their hand again)
- Different colored otters?
- Think about: game over when they go off the screen, is this ok?
- Double click swim faster
- Feedback when clicking empty space
- Faster when with another
- Manager object for gray otters holding gray otters
- Another goal
- More juice
